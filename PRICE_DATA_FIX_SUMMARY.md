# Price Data Fix Summary

## Problem Description
The application was experiencing errors when trying to sell stocks or crypto due to missing price data. The error message was:
```
Error selling stock: Error: Data harga tidak tersedia. Silakan coba lagi dalam beberapa saat atau klik tombol refresh.
```

## Root Cause
The issue occurred because:
1. When price data was not available in the `prices` state, the sell functions would immediately throw an error
2. The `debouncedFetchPrices()` function was called but it had a 5-minute debounce delay, so it didn't immediately fetch fresh data
3. Users had to manually refresh or wait for the next scheduled price update

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Price Fetching in Sell Functions
**Files Modified:**
- `pages/index.js` - `handleSellStock()` and `handleSellCrypto()` functions

**Changes:**
- Added immediate price fetching when data is not available (bypassing the debounce)
- Fetch fresh prices for the specific asset being sold
- Update the prices state with fresh data
- Only throw error if fresh fetch also fails

**Before:**
```javascript
if (!priceData) {
  debouncedFetchPrices(); // 5-minute debounce delay
  throw new Error('Data harga tidak tersedia...');
}
```

**After:**
```javascript
if (!priceData) {
  // Fetch fresh prices immediately without debounce
  const response = await fetch('/api/prices', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({ stocks: [`${asset.ticker}.JK`], crypto: [] })
  });
  
  if (response.ok) {
    const data = await response.json();
    setPrices(prev => ({ ...prev, ...data.prices }));
    priceData = data.prices[tickerKey];
  }
  
  if (!priceData) {
    throw new Error('Data harga tidak tersedia...');
  }
}
```

### 2. Improved User Experience
**Files Modified:**
- `components/Portfolio.js` - `handleSellStock()` and `handleSellCrypto()` functions

**Changes:**
- Changed error modal to info modal when price data is not available
- Show "Memperbarui Data Harga" message instead of error
- Allow users to proceed with the sale (the main function will handle price fetching)

### 3. Added Loading States
**Files Modified:**
- `pages/index.js` - Added `sellingLoading` state
- `components/Portfolio.js` - Added `sellingLoading` prop

**Changes:**
- Added loading state during sell operations
- Pass loading state to AssetTable components
- Show loading indicators during price fetching

### 4. Better Error Handling
**Files Modified:**
- `pages/index.js` - Updated error handling in sell functions

**Changes:**
- Replace `alert()` calls with modal notifications
- Show success messages when sales complete
- Better error messages with more context

### 5. Added Modal Support
**Files Modified:**
- `pages/index.js` - Added Modal import and component

**Changes:**
- Import Modal component
- Add Modal to JSX for displaying confirmations and errors
- Support for success, error, and info modal types

## Testing

### Test Script Created
- `test-sell-functionality.js` - Comprehensive test suite for the sell functionality

**Tests Include:**
1. Basic prices API test
2. Multiple stocks test (simulating sell scenario)
3. Error handling test with invalid tickers

### How to Run Tests
```bash
# Start the development server
npm run dev

# In another terminal, run the test
node test-sell-functionality.js
```

## Benefits of the Fix

1. **Immediate Resolution**: Price data is fetched immediately when needed, eliminating the need to wait
2. **Better User Experience**: Users see loading states and informative messages instead of errors
3. **Robust Error Handling**: Graceful handling of API failures with user-friendly notifications
4. **Success Feedback**: Users get confirmation when sales complete successfully
5. **Maintainable Code**: Clean separation of concerns and better error handling patterns

## Files Modified

1. `pages/index.js`
   - Enhanced `handleSellStock()` and `handleSellCrypto()` functions
   - Added `sellingLoading` state
   - Added Modal component and confirmModal state
   - Improved error handling with notifications

2. `components/Portfolio.js`
   - Updated sell handlers to show info modals instead of errors
   - Added `sellingLoading` prop support
   - Pass loading state to AssetTable components

3. `test-sell-functionality.js` (new file)
   - Comprehensive test suite for sell functionality

## Verification

To verify the fix works:
1. Start the application: `npm run dev`
2. Try to sell a stock when price data is not available
3. The system should automatically fetch fresh price data
4. You should see loading indicators and success/error notifications
5. Run the test script: `node test-sell-functionality.js`

The fix ensures that users can sell their assets even when price data is temporarily unavailable, providing a much better user experience.
